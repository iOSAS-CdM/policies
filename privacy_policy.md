**Effective Date:** November 24, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how a group of 4th Year BSIT students at Colegio de Montalban ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information. This policy applies to our entire suite of applications created for our capstone project, including the OSAS API, the iOSAS mobile application, the Administrative Staff desktop application, and the Superadmin desktop application (collectively, the "Services").

The Services are independent student research products and are **not** official Colegio de Montalban systems. We do not act on behalf of, nor do we represent, any CdM office. This document is intended to inform you, as a user of our Services, about our data practices. As this is a capstone project, our primary goal is academic and functional, but we are committed to protecting your privacy and to honoring CdM's intellectual property rights.

## 1.1 Non-Affiliation Statement

The Services are developed solely for academic research. All Colegio de Montalban trademarks, logos, and official platforms remain the exclusive property of CdM. Use of the Services should not be interpreted as an endorsement by CdM, and the Services must not be used to interfere with or impersonate any official CdM system.
