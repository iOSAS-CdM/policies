# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** September 9, 2025

## 1. Introduction

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the OSAS API, the iOSAS mobile application, the Administrative Staff desktop application, and the Superadmin desktop application (collectively, the "Services"). The Services are provided by a group of 4th Year BSIT students at Colegio de Montalban ("we," "us," or "our") as part of a capstone project.

By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## 1.1 Non-Affiliation Statement

The Services are independent student research products. They are not official Colegio de Montalban platforms, and using them does not create a relationship with, or endorsement by, any CdM office. You agree not to use the Services to impersonate, interfere with, or otherwise represent yourself as an official CdM system.

## 2. Use of the Services

*   **Eligibility:** You must be a current student or authorized staff member of Colegio de Montalban to use these Services.
*   **Acceptable Use:** You agree not to misuse the Services. This includes, but is not limited to, attempting to gain unauthorized access, interfering with the proper working of the Services, or using the Services for any unlawful purpose.

## 2.1 Pre-Implementation Status and Feedback

The Services are currently in a pre-implementation, evaluation phase. Functionality may be incomplete and you may encounter bugs or limitations. We encourage you to submit a support ticket through the in-app channel or contact us at the email in Section 9 when you experience an issue so we can improve the platform.

## 3. Accounts

*   **Account Creation:** You may need to create an account to access certain features. You are responsible for providing accurate and complete information.
*   **Account Security:** You are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

## 4. Intellectual Property

*   **Our Services:** We, the student developers, retain rights only to the original code and materials we created for this academic project. The Services are provided solely for research and educational use and should not be used to represent official Colegio de Montalban systems.
*   **User Content:** You retain ownership of the content you post or submit through the Services ("User Content"). By submitting User Content, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display, and distribute your User Content in connection with providing the Services.
*   **Colegio de Montalban Property:** All Colegio de Montalban trademarks, logos, and official content remain the exclusive property of CdM. Nothing in these Terms grants you ownership or licensing rights to any CdM intellectual property, and you agree not to reproduce or distribute CdM materials without authorization.

## 5. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time, with or without cause or notice, for any reason, including for a breach of these Terms. This is especially relevant as the project has a defined academic lifecycle.

## 6. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

*   **"AS IS" Service:** The Services are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. As this is a student project in active development, we do not make any warranties about the reliability, accuracy, or availability of the Services.
*   **Limitation of Liability:** To the fullest extent permitted by law, we, the student developers, shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, resulting from your use of the Services.

## 7. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms shall be instituted exclusively in the courts of Rizal, Philippines.

## 8. Changes to These Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of changes by posting the updated Terms within the applications. Your continued use of the Services after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

## 10. Support Tickets and Issue Reporting
